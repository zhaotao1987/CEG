Welcome to the ZhaoLab GitHub repository! This repository serves as a centralized hub for sharing scripts, tools, and files developed by the Zhao research group @ Northwest A&F University. Our group focuses on Comparative and Evolutionary Genomics, especially in Rosaceae. 

In this repository, you will find a collection of scripts, pipelines, and other resources that have been created and used by our team. These materials cover a wide range of topics, including genome annotation, genotyping, gene family characterization, etc.
